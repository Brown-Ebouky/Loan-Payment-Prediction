# Loan Payment Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict wether a person giving its characteristics, characteristics of a loan he want to take, is going to payback his loan to the bank
or not.
We perform data analysis to understand the data and we build several algorithms

### Algorithms (K-NN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression)
We used several machine learning classification algorithms and analyzed their performance in our data.
We then selected the one with the best performance on our data.
